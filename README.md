#A digital lean canvas

Why? Because I found it on TWG's blog and thought it was super cool! 

Reading more about the methods, I decided to try and make this digital version. Good way to sloooowly read this 40-page PDF https://leanstack.com/LeanCanvas.pdf and do some work on it. 

Uses React and Redux, plus CSS Grid for the layout.
